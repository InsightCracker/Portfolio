                    📊 Executive Summary<br />
                    This report presents an overview of e-commerce customer behavior and sales performance for the 2023–2024 period, analyzed using SQL and Power BI. Total sales amounted to ₺4.92 million from 5,000 customers, with an average order value of ₺983.11. Electronics, Home & Garden, and Sports were the top-performing categories, while Books and Food recorded the lowest sales. Istanbul led all cities with ₺1.33 million in revenue, followed by Ankara and Izmir.<br />

                    📝 Business Problem<br />
                    The e-commerce company faced challenges in understanding customer purchasing behavior, sales performance, and revenue distribution across product categories and locations. The absence of a centralized analytical system limited management’s ability to track key performance indicators (KPIs), identify high-performing segments, and evaluate the effectiveness of discounts and marketing strategies. <br />

                    Additionally, decision-making was hindered by fragmented data sources and a lack of real-time visibility into customer trends, payment preferences, and delivery performance. To address these issues, a data-driven analytical dashboard was developed using Power BI to integrate sales, demographic, and operational data enabling actionable insights for improving sales strategies, customer retention, and overall business performance. <br />

                    This HR Absenteeism Analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of employee absence patterns using multiple behavioral, demographic, and operational indicators. The findings reveal that absenteeism is heavily influenced by health-related factors, commute challenges, age groups, and work tenure, with significant seasonal and monthly fluctuations. <br />
                    🔍Key highlights<br />
                    Total Absenteeism Hours: 5,100+ hours<br />
                    Total Absentees: 737<br />

                    Average Employee Age: 36.4 years<br />
                    Peak absenteeism occurs in February, March, and July.<br />
                    The 30–39 age group accounts for the highest number of absences.<br />
                    Medical consultations and musculoskeletal issues are the leading reasons for absence.<br />
                    Employees with longer service (11–19 years) contribute significantly more hours of absence.<br />

                    🧾Conclusion<br />
                    This analysis provides a detailed understanding of absenteeism drivers related to health, lifestyle, commute, demographics, service time, and seasonal factors.
